This is the first entry.  Moroni is a boss in Alma Chapter 45.
I wish I could be like him someday.  He had a lot of faith and repentance.  He is a man.  I want to be a man.
Alma 30:18 is what it's all about.  Look up. Cool part 2 Nephi 33:12.  

 
It has several lines.
 
This is the last line

Kishkumen is so dumb in Helaman 10:10.  I don't even think he is cool.  He is not like Jesus at all.

Alma chapter 7 is awsome.
